# This bundle is made by Kenny Liou
# Acknowledgement to the original sass bundle, without it, this bundle means nothing
# NOTE: YOU NEED 'plist' gem to run this bundle
# gem install plist

# WARNNING: when running this bundle, due to TextMate's shell environment, 
# a actual Terminal will be activated
# and run some ruby script. Make sure you can run ruby script on your machine
# MAKE SURE you have a terminal in the front that's not doing anything 
# (i.e. not running any process like forever ping)
# bascially anything that will stop a ruby script running should not be 
# the "front most" Terminal (you can have them running on different tab, just make sure 
#the one on focus has nothing running)

# To check the actual plist that's generated, you can look at TextMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Support/mixins.plist
